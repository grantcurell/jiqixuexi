    "Let $X_1, X_2, ... , X_N$ be iid random variables independently/identically distributed. Identically\n",

    "## Required Understanding of [Variance](#variance)\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to understand the expectation/mean. $E[S_n]=np=E[X_1]+...+E[X_n]$. We know this from the rule *linearity of\n",
    "expectation* which says the expectation of a sum is equal to the sum of the expectations. Each of the random variables\n",
    "has expectation $p$ beacuse the probability of $X_i=1$ we defined as $p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our problem $Var[S_n]=npq=np(1-p)$. We explain why below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember the variance is <br>\n",
    "$Var[Y]=E[(Y-\\mu)^2]$ where $\\mu=E[Y]$ <br>\n",
    "=$E[Y^2]-E[Y]^2$ <br>\n",
    "$Var[Y+Y']=Var[Y]+Var[Y']$ where $Y,Y'$ are iid.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means the sum $S_n$ is the sum of the independent variances ($X_i$). We can use the rule $E[Y^2]-E[Y]^2$ to calculate the variance of an $X_i$. In our case $X_i$ has the property that $X_i^2$ is only either 1 or zero so $E[Y^2]$ is just 1 with probability $p$ and we know its expectation is only $p$ so we get $p-p^2$. Factor out the $p$ and you get $p(1-p)$ which we know is the same as $pq$.\n",
    "\n",
    " $Var[X_i]=p-p^2=p(1-p)=pq$.\n",
    "\n",
    " You can now use the equation $Var[Y+Y']=Var[Y]+Var[Y']$. Since each $X_i$ has variance $pq$ then the variance of $S_n$ is simply $npq$.\n",

    "### Constants in Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "$Var[Y+c]=Var[Y]$. A constant is just a value that is independent of everything else and subsequently does not affect\n",

    "We frequently work with standard deviation because the units are more intuitive. You could use the variance but consider\n",
    "that variance is $\\sigma^2$ which means our units would be squared. We square everything to make sure it is positive.\n",
    "However remember that when we do $\\sqrt \\sigma^2$ now there are two possible answers - one negative one positive.\n",

    "## Strategy - Use Standardization of Mean and Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have some random variable it is helpful to start by finding it's mean and variance first. If you can do both of\n",
    "these things you should standardize your random variable which means make it have mean 0 and variance 1. You can\n",
    "arrange for that by performing some operations which we call standardizing the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Get Mean 0\n",
    "\n",
    "$S_n-np$ Remember $np=E[S_n]$ which is the same as the mean. That is to say, to get $S_n=0$ you subtract the mean from\n",
    "it. This operation is sometimes called [*centering*](https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/center-on-the-mean/). You subtract a constant (here the mean) from every value of the variable in the set. You can see the effect with the dice:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/2021-06-15-10-30-33.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This *does not* affect the variance which you can see from the rule $Var[Y+c]=Var[Y]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Get var 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiply $1/stddev$. Remember the stddev is the square root of the variance. So you get\n",
    "$np=\\dfrac{S_n-np}{\\sqrt(npq)}$ where $\\sqrt(npq)=\\sigma$. That makes a random variable with mean 0 and variance 1 and therefore standard\n",
    " deviation 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general if you have any random variable you could define the standardized version as\n",
    "$Z=\\dfrac{S-\\mu}{\\sigma}$ where $\\mu$ is the mean and $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation of $S$.\n",

    "**TODO** what does S mean here.\n",
    "\n",
    "$Pr[S\\le u]=Pr[\\mu+\\sigma Z\\le u]=Pr[Z\\le\\dfrac{u-\\mu}{\\sigma}]$\n",

To make this calculation we use an *estimator* equation based on the sample data which must be drawn without observational bias from the whole population. The simplest estimators for population mean and variance are the mean and the variance of the sample. They are *consistent estimators* which means they converge to the correct values as the number of samples increases.
