    "Let's say we have a really strange dice that follows the above discrete probability distribution. We are going to take samples of it, then average the samples, and look at the frequency of the averages (mean) we get.\n",

    "Say we have sample size of $n=4$. Then $S_1=[1,1,3,6]$ which gives you $\\bar{x_1}=2.75$. Note: This would be the first sample. It is a sample of samples!\n",

    "## Setup\n",
    "Let $X_1, X_2, ... , X_N$ be iid random variables independently/identically distributed. Identically\n",
    "distributed means that they come from the same probability distribution. The variables have $Pr[X_i=1]=p$ and\n",
    "$Pr[x_i=0]=1-p=q$ probability. You could say each $X_i$ is a bernoulli random variable with probability of success $p$.\n",
    "Let $S_n=X_1+X_2+...+X_n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Required Understanding of Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to understand the expectation/mean. $E[S_n]=np=E[X_1]+...+E[X_n]$. We know this from the rule *linearity of\n",
    "expectation* which says the expectation of a sum is equal to the sum of the expectations. Each of the random variables\n",
    "has expectation $p$ beacuse the probabilyt of $X_i=1$ we defined as $p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$Var[S_n]=npq=np(1-p)$\n",
    "Remember the variance is $Var[Y]=E[(Y-\\mu)^2]$ where $\\mu=E[Y]$. Which is all equal to $E[Y^2]-E[Y]^2$. You also need\n",
    "this rule: $Var[Y+Y']=Var[Y]+Var[Y']$ where $Y,Y'$ are iid.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means the sum S_n is the sum of the independent variances $E[Y^2]-E[Y]^2 -> Var[X_i]=p-p^2=p(1-p)=pq$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constants in Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "$Var[Y+c]=Var[Y]$. A constant is just a value that is independent of everything else and subsequently does not affect\n",
    "the value of the variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "$Var[cY] = c^2Var[Y]$ <br>\n",
    "$stddev[Y]=\\sqrt(Var[Y])$\n",
    "\n",
    "We frequently work with standard deviation because the units are more intuitive. You could use the variance but consider\n",
    "that variance is $\\sigma^2$ which means our units would be squared. We square everything to make sure it is positive.\n",
    "However remember that when we do $\\sqrt \\sigma^2$ now there are two possible answers - one negative one positive.\n",

    "## Strategy - Use Standardization of Mean and Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have some random variable it is helpful to start by finding it's mean and variance first. If you can do both of\n",
    "these things you should standardize your random variable which means make it have mean 0 and variance 1. You can\n",
    "arrange for that by performing some operations which we call standardizing the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Get Mean 0\n",
    "\n",
    "$S_n-np$ Remember $np=E[S_n]$ which is the same as the mean. That is to say, to get $S_n=0$ you subtract the mean from\n",
    "it. This operation is sometimes called *centering*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Get var 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**TODO**: I don't really understand why these tricks work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiply $1/stddev$. Remember the stddev is the square root of the variance. So you get\n",
    "$np=\\dfrac{S_n-np}{\\sqrt(npq)}=\\sigma$. That makes a random variable with mean 0 and variance 1 and therefore standard\n",
    " deviation 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general if you have any random variable you could define the standardized version as\n",
    "$Z=\\dfrac{S-\\mu}{\\sigma}$ where $\\mu$ is the mean and $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation of $S$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$Pr[S\\le\\mu]=Pr[\\mu+\\sigma Z\\le u]=Pr[Z\\le\\dfrac{u-\\mu}{\\sigma}]$\n",
    "\n",
    "If you understand the distribution of $S$ then you also understand the distribution of $Z$ and vice versa.\n",

    "the terms $2X_1-1+2X_2-1$ are each half the time -1 or +1 because the value of $X$ is either 0 or 1. These are called *Radamacher Random Variables*.\n",
