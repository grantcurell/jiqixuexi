# Exercise 1.4

Let us  create our own target function f  and  data set 1) and see how the perceptron learning algorithm works. Take d =  2 so you  can  visualize the problem,  and  choose a  random line  in the plane  as your target function, where one side of the line maps to 1 and the other maps to -1. Choose the  inputs Xn of the  data set as random points  in  the plane, and evaluate the target function on each Xn to get the corresponding output YnÂ· Now, generate a data set of size 20. Try the perceptron learning algorithm on your data set  and see how long it takes to converge and how well the final hypothesis g matches your target f. You can  find other ways to play with this experiment in  Problem 1.4.
