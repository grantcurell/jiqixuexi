# Exercise 1.6

For each of the following tasks, identify which type of learning is involved (supervised,  reinforcement, or unsupervised) and the training data  to  be used.  If a  task can  fit more than one type, explain how and  describe the training data for each type.
- Recommending a  book to a  user in  an online  bookstore
  - Supervised - online learning
- Playing tic tac toe
  - Reinforcement learning (though the game is simple enough you could do this with supervised learning)
- Categorizing movies into different types
  - Unsupervised learning
-  Learning to play music
   -  All learning types. Ex: Learning to identify a tune, you frequently use a list of correctly labeled data and then guess yourself, and compare your answer. You might also have a teacher for whom you play who then provides you feedback. If you want to develop your musical capabilities, it is common to encourage people to listen to multiple types of complex music such that you develop an ear for it.
